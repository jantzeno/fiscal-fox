## Abstract

The Budge and Expense Tracker, codename Fiscal Fox, is intended to aide communication between the Financial Managers and Program Managers within an organization to accomplish the enterpriseâ€™s goals. The web-based single page application (SPA) is intended to replace the distribution and coordination of the enterprise budget execution via copies of a spreadsheet. Managing the budget via copies of a master spreadsheet is inefficient and changing one spreadsheet among dozens of copies invalids the others and requires manual reconciliation before the budget status can be determined. The proposed SPA allows Financial Managers to create budget items and view the status of the budget and allow Program Managers to record expenses against the budget items and view the status of a programs allotted budget. The SPA will be developed using Angular with TypeScript, Node.js, and SQLite. The application will utilize behavior-driven development using Jasmine and Karma, as well as Protractor for end-to-end (E2E) testing.

## Design Methods

The Budget and Expense Tracker, Fiscal Fox, is a web-based SPA using HTML5, SCSS, and Angular, NgRx, and Node.js with TypeScript. Information from the application will be stored in an SQLite database on the server.

## Use Cases
